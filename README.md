### Hello!

I'm a young (very young) musician and artist who also has an interest in programming. I started coding much later than my art/music hobby, and am a newbie to the field. 

**NOTE! Most of the project that I (may) put here are only for entertainment purposes and have no practical use.**

Some of the languages I know some bits of are C, D, Javascript, Pascal, and Rust. Portability is my main requisite, which means I prefer not the use of non-standard libraries.

You can find me on other platforms :
