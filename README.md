### Hello!

This is khoidauminh. You can call me KD (Kay-dee).

I'm a young (very young) musician and artist who also has an interest in programming. I started coding much later than my art/music hobby, and am basically a newbie to the field. 


**NOTE! Most of the project that I (may) put here are only for entertainment purposes and have no practical use.**

I don't plan on getting a job in software-engineering, web developing nor such (unless..?). Please don't bring up backend topics because I have nothing to talk about them. I like graphics though.

Some of the languages I know some bits of are C, D, Javascript, Pascal, and Rust. I am also learning a bit of Haskell. I don't use IDEs. Portability is my main requisite, which means I don't like the use of non-standard libraries, but this doesn't mean I will become a crying kid when I have to import one. 

You can find me on other platforms : 
[Bandcamp](https://khoidauminh.bandcamp.com/)
[Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@khoidauminh)

Thank you for coming into my profile! That's all I have to say for now.
